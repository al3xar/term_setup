# Introduction
This is my quick setup script to custom my terminal environment on any machine or VM I move to.
Usually I do:
- Install Warp terminal (pretty cool)
- Install Oh My Posh (Like P10K but much nicer)
- Install Nord Aurora Theme (for Warp and Oh My Posh)

# Setup
Run this command for quick setup.
```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/al3xar/term_setup/blob/main/setup.sh | bash
```
